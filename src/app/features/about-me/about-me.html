        For a decade, I led product teams at major tech companies like Wanda Pictures and iQIYI, driving user growth
        and optimizing digital experiences for millions of users. While I loved defining the "what" and "why" of a
        product, my profound passion for technology drove me to master the "how."
    </p>
    <p>
        I pivoted to development to gain full creative control over the product lifecycle. Today, I don't just write
        code; I engineer solutions. My background allows me to strategically balance business goals with technical
        execution.

        I am currently refining my skills in the Web and Mobile Application Development program at Conestoga College
        while building independent projects like Speaking Pass (an IELTS preparation tool) and LingoPick (a language
        learning extension). My tech stack includes TypeScript, React 19, Next.js, and Supabase.
