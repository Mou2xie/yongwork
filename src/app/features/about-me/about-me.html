    <p>Hi, I'm Yong Xie, an atypical developer.</p>

    <p>Before diving deep into the world of code, I spent over 10 years navigating the tech industry as a Product
        Manager.</p>

    <p>My career began in 2012, right at the onset of the golden age of China's mobile internet boom. As a product
        professional deeply rooted in the industry, I worked for major enterprises like <strong>iQIYI</strong> and
        <strong>Wanda Pictures</strong>, managing online products with over <strong>150,000 DAU</strong>. I also thrived
        in startup environments, guiding products through the challenging "0 to 1" lifecycle.
    </p>

    <p>In those years, I mastered the art of listening to users, balancing business goals with technical resources,
        and—most importantly—taking full ownership of results. This deep-seated product mindset and business acumen have
        now become my most valuable assets as a developer.</p>

    <p>After a decade of designing features and writing documentation, my creative drive wasn't dampened; it grew
        stronger. I realized I craved more than just "planning" the blueprint—I wanted to <strong>build</strong> it with
        my own hands.</p>

    <p>Driven by this passion, I started teaching myself to code outside of work. From scripting simple efficiency tools
        to independently developing browser extensions, full-stack applications, and AI workflows, I began turning my
        product concepts into reality, line by line.</p>

    <p>Now, having traveled halfway across the globe to <strong>Canada</strong>, I am embarking on a new journey.</p>

    <p>I am not just a traditional programmer; I am a partner who starts with business value and user experience. I
        leverage modern tech stacks like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, and <strong>Node.js</strong>,
        while also commanding <strong>AI Agent development</strong> and <strong>LLM integration</strong>, to build
        digital products that solve real problems and thrive in the market.</p>
